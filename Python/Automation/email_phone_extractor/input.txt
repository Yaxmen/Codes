A BETTER
LENDING PARTNER
We believe that your business is much more than a balance sheet and an income statement. At East Cambridge, we go beyond the numbers to understand the business, the people, and the lending need.
Business Lending
Upgrade to a Local Relationship
While many banks are focused on making sales, our intent is building long term relationships with our neighbors. We believe that our communities are uniquely prosperous due to the number of independent businesses thriving in our markets. As an advocate of the shop local movement, investing in our neighbors’ successes is at the core of our operations. So if your business could use a great partner in lending, consider upgrading your banking relationship to East Cambridge.
 
Business Loans & Lines of Credit 
Local businesses are the engine which helps drive the success of our communities and local economy. If you could use a business loan, we want to be your partner in financing.
Commercial Real Estate Lending 
Our communities are filled with unique and valuable opportunities in Commercial Real Estate. We want to finance your next purchase or loan for multi-family residences, retail and mixed-use property, apartment or condo buildings, and corporate office parks.
Construction Financing 
From a single unit to an entire sub-division, your next project deserves a lending partner that is authentically focused on your success. In addition to the varied loan options, we help you succeed with timely communication, direct access to decision makers, and a level of local expertise which can’t be matched elsewhere.
Small Business Express Loans
At East Cambridge, we offer a streamlined loan application process exclusively for businesses with revenues of $1 million or less. Talk to us today for loans from $5,000 to $250,000; we’ll do everything possible to get you the financing you need.
